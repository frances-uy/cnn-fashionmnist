# Assignment 4: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for FashionMNIS

The goal of this assignment is to implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
to classify images from the FashionMNIST dataset. You will learn how to preprocess the data,
build and train a CNN, and evaluate its performance.

## Project Overview

The analysis includes data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and comprehensive performance evaluation using multiple metrics.

## Dataset

**FashionMNIST** is a dataset of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each of
size 28x28 grayscale, categorized into 10 different fashion classes (e.g., T-shirt, dress, sneaker,
etc.).
